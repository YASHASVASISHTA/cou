                <h4>Why Personal Branding Matters in Creative Sales</h4>
                <p>When selling to individuals, especially creatives, your personal brand is often more important than your company brand:</p>

                    <li><strong>Social Proof:</strong> Your online presence serves as your portfolio</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Personal brands feel more approachable than corporate brands</li>
                    <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> Creatives value genuine, authentic connections</li>
